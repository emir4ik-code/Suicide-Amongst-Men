            <h2>Mental Health</h2>
            <h3>Men are less likely to seek help for Emotional Problems.</h3>
            <p>According to environmental research and public health studies, most suicides are related to psychiatric disease, depression, substance use disorders, and psychosis. Research suggests that depression is diagnosed less frequently in men because
                of the tendency to deny illness, self-monitor symptoms, and self-treat.</p>
            </p>
            <h2>Sexual/Physical Assault</h2>
            <h3>Men are less likely to report abuse.</h3>
            <p> The common misconception that Males cannot be sexual/physical assault victims aid in the rise of fatal suicide attempts among males. If they were to report sexual/physical assault, they are left with feelings of embarrassment and shame as
                society pushes the notion that males are supposed to be strong and unbreakable. </p>

            </p>
            <h2>Gender Orientation</h2>
            <h3>Members of the LGBTQUIA+ Community are subjected to violent actions.</h3>
            <p>Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death in men who are a part of the LGBTQUIA+ community. Many individuals described the feeling of isolation, invisibility, and loneliness among dealing with violence and homophobia. These feelings often
                lead to depression, sentiments of helplessness, and thoughts of suicide.
            </p>
            <h2>Traditional Notions of Masculinity</h2>
            <h3>Society says Men who show emotion are weak.</h3>
            <p>Male Gender Roles tend to emphasize greater levels of strength, independence, risk-taking behavior, economic status, and individualism. Lack of empathy towards men reinforces the "Real Men Dont Cry" stigma which forces men to put their emotions
                aside which often leaves them vunurable.
